If roses grow in heaven,

Lord please pick a bunch for me,

Place them in my Mother’s arms

And tell her they’re from me.



Tell her I love her and miss her,

And when she turns to smile,

Place a kiss upon her cheek

And hold her for a while.



Because remembering her is easy,

I do it every day,

But there’s an ache within my heart

That will never go away.
