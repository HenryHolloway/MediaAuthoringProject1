Far Out Space Facts!

Space Fact #1
The planet Jupiter is larger than 1,000 Earths!


Space Fact #2
The outer layers of the sun have what's known as "differential rotation". The equator of the surface rotates once every 25.4 days; but near the poles it rotates once every 36 days!

A neutron star is completely dense and solid matter. In fact, it weighs a trillion times heavier than lead. That means a piece of a neutron star the size of a pinhead would weigh as much as a large building!


Space Fact #4
The sun loses almost 4 million tons of mass every second by turning hydrogen gas into energy. That adds up to almost 345 billion tons per day!
