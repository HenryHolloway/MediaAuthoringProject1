Second entry in two months... so much for a new years resolution! I came back to this idea because something really weird happened to me today and I don't want to forget about it. I was walking down the bowery (chinatown is the only place to go for tea) when I ran into Sofia. I still don't know what she was doing in such a terrible neighborhood, especially so far from Arizona. It was really good to talk again, I haven't talked to her since she blocked my number. We're meeting together tomorrow; I'll probably write here again.
